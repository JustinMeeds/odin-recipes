# Odin Recipes

## Introduction

This project is a basic recipe website created to practice fundamental HTML skills. It demonstrates my ability to structure and link multiple web pages, implement semantic HTML, and organize content in a clear and functional way. The website includes a main index page linking to individual recipe pages, showcasing my understanding of creating and managing a multi-page site.

## Project Highlights

- **Multi-Page Structure:** A main index page links to individual recipe pages.
- **Semantic HTML:** Proper use of headings, paragraphs, images, and lists to structure content.
- **Navigation:** Internal links connect pages, ensuring seamless navigation across the site.

## Project Features

### Main Page (index.html)
- Acts as the homepage with links to all recipes.
- Organized navigation using an unordered list.

### Recipe Pages
Each recipe page includes:
- A title (h1) for the recipe name.
- An image of the dish.
- A brief description of the recipe.
- An unordered list of ingredients.
- An ordered list of preparation steps.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Structuring HTML files with semantic elements.
- Linking pages using relative paths.
- Organizing files and directories for project scalability.
- Publishing the project using GitHub Pages.

## Live Demo

## Future Potential

This project lays the foundation for future enhancements. In the next phases, I plan to:
- Style the website using CSS to improve its visual appeal.
- Add interactivity and functionality using JavaScript.

This project reflects my foundational skills in HTML and my ability to create a structured and functional website, which I look forward to building upon in future projects.
