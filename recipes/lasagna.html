            <li><b>Prepare the Turkey Sauce:</b>
            <ul>
                    <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat and drizzle with olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Sauté diced onion until translucent, then add minced garlic.</li>
                    <li>Cook the ground turkey until browned, seasoning with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.</li>
                    <li>Stir in marinara sauce and let simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Mix the Ricotta Layer:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a bowl, combine ricotta, 1 cup of mozzarella, the egg, and Parmesan cheese. Stir until smooth and creamy.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Assemble the Lasagna:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                    <li>Spread a thin layer of turkey marinara sauce at the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish.</li>
                    <li>Lay down a single layer of ready-to-cook noodles.</li>
                    <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of sauce and mozzarella.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the layers (noodles, ricotta, sauce, mozzarella) until all ingredients are used, ending with sauce and a heavy sprinkle of mozzarella.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Bake the Lasagna:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cover with foil, tenting it slightly to prevent it from sticking to the cheese, and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
